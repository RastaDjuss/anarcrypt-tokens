We must developpe faith in Chaos becaus its the natural way of thing. Nothing that comes from nature is organized. Look at start, forests etc, They are all Chaotic and spread out in a random manner not in rows like commercial agriculture and monoculture. Everything natural is Dynasmic and Chaotic. Thats why Punks love and want Chaos, its to start all over from the beginning to redo things right thisd time",
