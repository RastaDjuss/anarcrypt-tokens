 # It's a BiT Complicated...
 
## A Vulgar Display Of Power !,,!  

Punks Fuck the System, hop on stage and influence with confidence and attitude... Bits colonise and influence (but not Alone)... So you wanna' change things? Like a Punk!  Well, Be a Dick and Fuck it! Fuck the system. BiT is a bit of a joke...

# Join the Anti-Cult. 

   It all comes from Cant (troubadour hidden street rogue language), Slang and Vulgar Con expressions. For them, to speak is like cuming or ejaculating. Because it makes ideas sprout in peoples mind and builds culture like Punks Do! Mentality! Aspect number one of punk philosophy! So Culture grows the more you cum on it! Or in other words, affirmation changes things (not praying) and builds culture. 
  
   Plus If a good BiT finds a hen, the egg comes out the colour we want! Black !,,! Long Psycho story.... The inside war: Troy or 3... I understand that it is in some sort of way very viril and Masculin, thus discriminating a tad women as if they wouldn't be influencial because they have no Bit...(Freud) NonSense! Cunts, i Guess, might be a little Macho with such word games... 

By the Way, in french, Con is a vulgar way to say vagina like Cunt . And we know by nature cause we are all just like mammals cause we do it like they do it on the discovery channel! Bits fuck cunts would you imagine that! So speak out and fill em' up! The Wind of Change... 

# Yeah Fuck it! Speak to it! Shout it out Loud!

 Fuck You actually means use affirmation to influence, attract attention and show an example: to be marginal... For a Punk! And take no shit! Attitude that's it!

# It represents influence and affirmation. 
 
 So Give a BiT and Get Some... Byte size BiTs... 24x24 pixels of influence... Penis Envy! The Power of Affirmation and Influence... Bits Colonize but not alone... It is just Affirmation Shout it out! Like a Punk! It's a little macho but a cunt would understand...
 
 # Kick aSS!
